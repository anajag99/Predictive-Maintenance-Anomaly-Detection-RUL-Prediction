# Predictive-Maintenance-Anomaly-Detection-RUL-Prediction
This repository implements a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment using anomaly detection and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. The model combines One-Class SVM for anomaly detection and XGBoost regression for RUL prediction, applied to the NASA Turbofan Engine dataset.
